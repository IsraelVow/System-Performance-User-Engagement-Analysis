## **🎯 Key Features & Metrics**  

### **1️⃣ System Performance Monitoring**  
- **Uptime %** – Tracks system availability over time.  
- **Mean Time to Resolve (MTTR)** – Measures average downtime duration.  
- **Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)** – Analyzes system reliability.  
📊 *Visuals:* Gauge Chart | KPI Cards | Line Graph  

### **2️⃣ VoIP Quality Metrics**  
- **Mean Opinion Score (MOS)** – Evaluates user-perceived call quality.  
- **Round Trip Time (RTT)** – Monitors network latency for VoIP calls.  
- **Packet Loss Rate** – Measures lost data packets affecting call quality.  
📊 *Visuals:* Stacked Area Chart | Clustered Column Chart  

### **3️⃣ User Engagement Analysis**  
- **Daily Active Users (DAU) / Monthly Active Users (MAU)** – Tracks user activity.  
- **User Growth Rate** – Measures the percentage of new active users.  
- **Churn Rate** – Analyzes retention trends and lost users.  
📊 *Visuals:* Line Chart | Pie Chart  

### **4️⃣ Customer Support Performance**  
- **First Call Resolution (FCR)** – Measures support efficiency.  
- **Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT)** – Captures user feedback on support interactions.  
📊 *Visuals:* 100% Stacked Column Chart | Gauge Chart
